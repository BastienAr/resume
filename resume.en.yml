    Automatization, sharing & techno (music).
    I'm super lazy so I'm working super hard to make things be done by themselves. Kind of a paradox, right ?
    I'm hungry to learn, to share (I mean open sourcing, not my üçî !). If it's not simple, it's not done.

    summary: >
      At D2SI I'm being sent helping clients to create, automatize and strengthen their deployment procedures.
      It goes from development environment (git trunk-based, commit hooks) to CI/CD (docker, canari deployment, GithubAction).
      I also lead the internal hands-on lab process.
    highlights:
      - Automatization of a serverless stack deployment (AWS, Github) in prod, dev & integration
      - Kick start of a microservices oriented project
      - Few hands-on creation (about docker, CI/CD)

      At Sigfox I was helping the backend and test team to fasten and strengthen the deployment process.
      It means creating CI/CD pipeline, developing custom tools. In my last months there, I participate to the early steps of the
